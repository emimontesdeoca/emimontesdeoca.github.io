There's been times that I needed to show a client or a teammate a full screenshot of the current state of the website or even a part of it, so I've been using [Full Page Screen Capture](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/full-page-screen-capture/fdpohaocaechififmbbbbbknoalclacl?hl=en) and, for any other kind of screenshots, [Windows' Snippet tool](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13776/windows-use-snipping-tool-to-capture-screenshots) or [Snaggit](https://www.techsmith.com/store/snagit). If I want to host it online like in this post [Gyazo](https://gyazo.com), which also has a GIF maker.

Recently I found that **Devtools** has a tool that does a full-page screenshot, no extension needed!

This is not new thought, it was included in the [Devtools update in April 2017](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/devtools-release-notes), *but looks like I live under a rock and didn't find out until now...*

## Devtools

As stated in the [official Devtools page](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/?hl=en):

> Chrome DevTools is a set of web developer tools built directly into the Google Chrome browser. DevTools can help you edit pages on-the-fly and diagnose problems quickly, which ultimately helps you build better websites, faster.

## Running commands in Devtools

You already know how to open Devtools but in case you just forgot and *for the sake of this post*, open it using the key `F12` or the shortcut `Ctrl + Shift + I`. Then you have to open the `Run command` in the menu inside Devtools or use `Ctrl + Shift + P`.

If you type `screenshot` it will filter the commands, there will be 4 types of screenshots methods that you can use:

1. Area screenshot
2. Full size screenshot
3. Node screenshot
4. Capture screenshot

Before checking all the screenshots methods, after devtools finishes processing the image, **it will automatically download it with the name of the webpage**.
